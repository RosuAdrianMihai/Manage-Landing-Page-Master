# Manage-Landing-Page-Master

Welcome to my repository. 

This is a Frontend Mentor challenge: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/manage-landing-page-SLXqC6P5.

Technologies used: HTML5, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript and Alpine.Js

Project description:

In this project, my main objective was to build a beautiful UI that highlights my layout skills. This is the first time I've used Tailwind CSS to create a mobile-first page.
The site is fully responsive, adapting to any device. There are touches of JavaScript and Alpine.Js that ensure the functionality of the mobile menu, testimonials, and email
validation. Overall, I'm satisfied by the building experience that came with this project as I've learned some basic animations patterns and how to implement basic Alpine.Js.

I had some struggles, especially around the mobile menu as the items within were selectable even tho they weren't displayed. Another problem that I had was around the navbar on
the desktop, which was bigger than the width of the page and determined the appearance of a horizontal scrollbar. This took some time to solve, as I didn't know what part of the 
page was causing this. Luckily, I was organized, splitting everything into "components" and commenting them to find out where was the horizontal scrollbar coming from.
